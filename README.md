# Temperature-and-Air-humidity-Forecasting
Data Mining Project - SAS 

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to forecast temperature and air humidity based on air quality data using SAS Enterprise. The analysis utilizes a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes hourly air quality measurements from an urban background station in Italy.

Project Overview
Introduction: The project aims to understand the impact of air pollution on temperature and humidity, using extensive data analysis and machine learning models.
Data Description: The dataset includes hourly averaged responses from air quality chemical sensors and certified analyzer readings for various pollutants.
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: We performed comprehensive data cleaning, handled missing values, and identified relevant features for our models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand data properties, relationships between variables, and to prepare the data for modeling.
Modeling: Implemented time series forecasting models to predict temperature and absolute humidity.
